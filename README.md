# Australian-Government-Health-Spending-
This is essentially an attempt to determine and summarise the main sources of funding, and the main areas of expenditure by different Australian State Governments from 1998-2012 financial years, using publicly available data from data.gov.au. 
I hope to be able to use the learning here and apply it to different contexts, for example, in marketing strategies, medical research, etc. As I am sure you can see from my code, I am just starting out with this stuff and am eager to learn more and more. 
Ultimately, I am hoping to be able to translate the data analysis techniques learnt here and apply them to machine learning algorithms. 
I am primarily interesting in applying data analysis and machine learning algorithms in the field of medicine, a field that I believe machine learning can help to significantly reduce costs and combat the issue of health inequity globally.
